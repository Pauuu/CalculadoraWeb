## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

+ Margin radius using the '%' works different than using the others units.
+ How to use the custom properties of CSS (still learning btw).
+ How to change the theme (must improve).

### Useful resources

- [Grid guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) 
- [Theme switcher](https://alexandersandberg.com/theme-switcher/) - This article which helped me finally understand how to switch between themes whitout using JS. I still have to learn and improve more with more practice, but it's a start. [Checkout his GitHub account](https://github.com/alexandersandberg)
